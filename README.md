## Introduction 

Customer retention is a cornerstone of long-term business success, especially in industries like telecommunications where acquiring new customers incurs high costs. Customer churn—when subscribers cancel or switch to competitors—negatively impacts revenue and increases operational and marketing expenses. Accurately predicting and mitigating churn has become a strategic priority for telecom providers aiming to maintain market share and profitability.

Machine learning (ML) provides powerful tools for identifying at-risk customers, analyzing behavioral trends, and designing targeted retention strategies. This project applies both supervised and unsupervised ML techniques to develop a predictive churn framework and segment customers based on behavior. 
 
Data Source: [Telco Customer Churn Dataset – Kaggle ](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alfathterry/telco-customer-churn-11-1-3)

The dataset comprises various customer-level features, including tenure, monthly charges, contract type, and satisfaction score. The project objectives are: 
1. Customer Behavior Analysis: Apply clustering and dimensionality reduction to uncover latent customer segments.
2. Churn Prediction Modeling: Build and evaluate classification models to predict churn likelihood.
3. Business Insight Extraction: Translate predictive insights into actionable retention strategies. 

To accomplish these objectives, the project implements a full ML pipeline including preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and validation. Dimensionality reduction methods (PCA, t-SNE, UMAP) were used to visualize patterns and support segmentation. Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost models were trained for churn prediction, with XGBoost achieving the highest balanced performance.
